# Sandwich Club Project Submission By Jasdeep Singh

## Project Overview
Waheguru ji
This is submission project code which is part udacity android developer course.
The **Sandwich Club** app shows the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

## Why this Project
Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON
is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually
done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for  this project will
help you to better understand how it is processed.

## What I learnt?
Through this project, I:
- Learnt how to submit projects for review
- Practice JSON parsing to a model object
- Design an activity layout
- Populate all fields in the layout accordingly

## How I completeted this Project?
- I downloaded the [Sandwich Club app starter code.](https://github.com/udacity/sandwich-club-starter-code)

- I designed the layout for the detail activity so the different elements
display in a sensible way.

- I implemented the JSON parsing in [`JsonUtils`](/app/src/main/java/com/udacity/sandwichclub/utils/JsonUtils.java) so it
produces a Sandwich Object that can be used to populate the UI that you designed.
